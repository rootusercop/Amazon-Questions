Question:
The closest common ancestor in a tree forest in O(1) memory.


class Node {
    Node* parent; // == null for root of tree
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
}

Node* tree_forest[]; // array of pointers which points to roots of each tree respectively

Node* closest_common_ancestor(Node* n1, Node* n2) {
    // your solution
}
Example:


|    a     |   j
|   / \    |  /
|  b   c   | h
| /   / \  |
|d   e   f |
for e and d CCA is a 
for e and f CCA is c 
for e and c CCA is c 
for h and d CCA is null 

CONSTRAINS: O(1) ADDITIONAL MEMORY

 * ALGORITHM AND HINT:
 
Interviewer gave me a hint: it's better to consider the case when n1 and n2 lays on the same level of tree 
(in my example b, c, h lays on same level of trees) 

Case 1. 
Let's assume that n1 and n2 lays on the same level. 
In this case we can just go up over the tree simultaneously. 
Then we face situation when n1 == n2 we done. 

Case 2. 
1) We need to count level for both nodes. 
2) Align levels by following parent on node with higher level. 
3) Do Case 1 solution.
 
* Algorithm:
	        1. GET LEVELS of the two nodes
	        2. Make the LEVELS EQUAL irrespective of the fact whether nodes are in SAME tree or DIFFERENT tree
	        3. TRAVERSE THE PARENTS unless both parents are equal OR either parent is null
