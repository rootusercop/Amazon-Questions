Question: Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set 
with sum equal to given sum.




VERY VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: The Recursive & DP approach WON'T WORK for NEGATIVE Numbers present either in ARRAY ELEMENTS OR SUM



Examples: set[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}, sum = 9
Output:  True  //There is a subset (4, 5) with sum 9.
Let isSubSetSum(int set[], int n, int sum) be the function to find whether there is a subset of set[] with 
sum equal to sum. n is the number of elements in set[].
