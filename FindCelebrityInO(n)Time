Question: Given a set of n people, find the celebrity. 
Celebrity is a person who: 
1. Knows only himself and no one else 
2. Every one else knows this person 
Devise a O(n) algorithm to find the solution.

Celebrity Problem
In a group of n people, a celebrity is somebody whom everybody knows, but who knows no one else.

Problem: 
1. If we can ask questions of the form “does person i know person j?” 
2. How many questions do we need to find a celebrity, if one exists?
3. How should we structure the information?

Celebrity Problem (cont)
Formulate as an n × n boolean matrix M.
Mij = 1 iff i knows j.
     Example:   1 0 0 1 0
				1 1 1 1 1
				1 0 1 1 1
				0 0 0 1 0
				1 1 1 1 1
VERY IMP STATEMENT FOR FORMULATION OF ALGORITHM: A CELEBRITY HAS ALL 0’S IN HIS ROW AND ALL 1’S IN HIS COLUMN.
THERE CAN BE AT MOST ONE CELEBRITY.(i.e. EITHER 0 OR 1 CELEBRITY CAN BE PRESENT IN ADJ. MATRIX)
THERE CANNOT BE 2 OR MORE CELEBRITIES.

Clearly, O(n^2) questions suffice. Can we do better?
 * 
 *Efficient Celebrity Algorithm
Appeal to induction:
1. If we have an n × n matrix, how can we reduce it to an (n − 1) × (n − 1) matrix?
2. What are ways to select the n’th person?

Efficient Celebrity Algorithm (cont)
1. ELIMINATE ONE PERSON IF HE IS A NON-CELEBRITY.
2. STRIKE ONE ROW AND ONE COLUMN.
                1 0 0 1 0
				1 1 1 1 1
				1 0 1 1 1
				0 0 0 1 0
				1 1 1 1 1
DOES 1 KNOW 3? NO. 3 IS A NON-CELEBRITY.
DOES 2 KNOW 5? YES. 2 IS A NON-CELEBRITY.
OBSERVATION: EACH QUESTION ELIMINATES ONE NON-CELEBRITY.				

CELEBRITY ALGORITHM

Efficient Celebrity Algorithm
1. ELIMINATE ONE PERSON IF HE IS A NON-CELEBRITY.
2. STRIKE ONE ROW AND ONE COLUMN.

Algorithm:
1 Ask n − 1 questions to eliminate n − 1 non-celebrities.
This leaves one candidate who might be a celebrity.
2 Ask 2(n − 1) questions to check candidate.
Analysis:
Θ(n) questions are asked.

Example:
                1 0 0 1 0
				1 1 1 1 1
				1 0 1 1 1
				0 0 0 1 0
				1 1 1 1 1
Does 1 know 2? No. Eliminate 2
Does 1 know 3? No. Eliminate 3
Does 1 know 4? Yes. Eliminate 1
Does 4 know 5? No. Eliminate 5
