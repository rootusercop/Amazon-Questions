         * Find all intervals intersecting with the given interval
         * 
         * Quoting from CLRS:
         * ------------------
         * Use a simple ordered tree, for example a binary search tree or self-balancing binary search tree, where the tree is
         * ordered by the 'low' values of the intervals, and an extra annotation is added to every node recording the maximum high value of both its subtrees.
         * It is simple to maintain this attribute in only O(h) steps during each addition or removal of a node, where h is the height of the node added or
         * removed in the tree, by updating all ancestors of the node from the bottom up. Additionally, the tree rotations used
         * during insertion and deletion may require updating the high value of the affected nodes.
         * 
         * Now, it is known that two intervals A and B overlap only when both A.low ≤ B.high and A.high ≥ B.low. When searching the trees for nodes overlapping with a given interval, you can immediately skip:
         * 1. All nodes to the right of nodes whose low value is past the end of the given interval.
         * 2. All nodes that have their maximum 'high' value below the start of the given interval.
